## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: PPT artifacts SHALL support rich semantic slide blocks

PPT artifact content SHALL accept a richer structured slide model in addition to the legacy simple `title` / `bullets` / `layout` slide shape. The richer model MUST remain JSON-serializable, MUST be renderable in the preview panel, and MUST be exportable to `.pptx`.

#### Scenario: Agent creates a rich PPT deck
- **WHEN** `write_artifact` receives a PPT artifact containing semantic slide blocks such as metrics, columns, timelines, quotes, callouts, or bullet groups
- **THEN** AgentHub stores a typed PPT artifact content payload
- **AND** the preview panel renders the blocks using the deck theme and layout rules
- **AND** the artifact remains editable as JSON in the artifact panel.

#### Scenario: Legacy PPT deck is opened
- **WHEN** an existing PPT artifact contains only legacy simple slides
- **THEN** AgentHub renders and exports it without data migration
- **AND** normalizes the legacy fields to equivalent semantic blocks at render/export time.

### Requirement: PPT export SHALL expose editable and visual-priority modes

PPT artifacts SHALL export to a real `.pptx` file. Editable export MUST preserve semantic text and shapes where possible. Visual-priority export MUST be an explicit mode; when a renderer is configured, it MUST produce image-backed slides for custom visual markup that cannot be faithfully represented as editable PowerPoint elements. When no renderer is available, it MUST fail clearly without affecting editable export.

#### Scenario: User downloads editable PPTX
- **WHEN** a user exports a PPT artifact without selecting visual-priority mode
- **THEN** AgentHub generates a `.pptx` using semantic slide blocks through the PowerPoint export pipeline
- **AND** text and basic shapes remain editable in PowerPoint where supported by the block type.

#### Scenario: Visual export renderer is unavailable
- **WHEN** visual-priority export is requested but the configured renderer is unavailable
- **THEN** AgentHub returns a clear export error
- **AND** editable export remains available for the same PPT artifact.

### Requirement: PPT artifact assets SHALL avoid unbounded binary JSON

PPT artifact content MUST NOT store large binary slide assets directly in the JSON payload. Images and custom visual resources SHALL be referenced by bounded URLs, existing attachment/artifact identifiers, or workspace-backed paths that can be resolved safely.

#### Scenario: Agent creates a slide with an image
- **WHEN** a PPT slide references an image asset
- **THEN** the artifact content stores a safe reference rather than raw unbounded binary bytes
- **AND** preview/export code resolves the asset through existing safe artifact, attachment, or workspace access paths.
