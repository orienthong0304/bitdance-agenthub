# Add Task Contract Artifact Handoff

## Why

Group orchestration currently treats each sub-task mostly as free-form text plus `dependsOn`. That is enough for basic DAG scheduling, but it leaves artifact handoff implicit: downstream agents must infer which upstream artifacts to read, and the executor only knows that some artifact was created, not whether the task delivered the promised output.

AgentHub should make multi-agent collaboration more reliable by turning each dispatch task into an explicit contract: required inputs, expected outputs, and acceptance criteria.

## What Changes

- Extend dispatch plans with task-level `inputs`, `expectedOutputs`, and `acceptanceCriteria`.
- Extend `plan_tasks` so Orchestrator can declare artifact handoff contracts in structured form.
- Compile `inputs` into `dependsOn` and validate that input references match upstream expected outputs.
- Let `write_artifact` accept an optional `outputKey` that binds a produced artifact to an expected output id.
- Inject required inputs, expected outputs, and acceptance criteria into child prompts.
- Treat unresolved required inputs as scheduling skips; task completion itself is reported through `report_task_result`.
- Show task contracts in the dispatch plan card.

## Impact

- Affects Orchestrator planning, dispatch validation, child prompt construction, and artifact creation.
- Keeps the existing three-stage Orchestrator model: plan, execute DAG, aggregate.
- Does not introduce a workflow framework or persist DAG state in this change.
