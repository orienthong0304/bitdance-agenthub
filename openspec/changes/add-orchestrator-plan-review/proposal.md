# Add Orchestrator Plan Review

## Why

The Orchestrator currently executes a generated dispatch plan as soon as it passes deterministic validation. That is fast, but it gives users no chance to correct a poor task split, fix agent assignment, adjust dependencies, or tighten artifact handoff contracts before child agents start doing work.

AgentHub should let users review and edit the Orchestrator plan at the collaboration boundary: after planning, before DAG execution.

## What Changes

- Add a pending dispatch plan review state between Stage 1 PLAN and Stage 2 EXECUTE.
- Publish pending plan review events over SSE and expose REST endpoints to list and resolve pending plans.
- Let the UI edit task instructions, agent assignment, dependencies, expected outputs, inputs, and acceptance criteria before approval.
- Re-compile and validate the edited plan on the server before launching child agent runs.
- Allow rejecting a pending plan, ending the Orchestrator run without child tasks.
- Keep dispatch execution and aggregation unchanged after approval.

## Impact

- Affects Orchestrator execution, StreamEvent payloads, Zustand dispatch state, and the dispatch plan card UI.
- Uses the existing in-memory pending queue pattern from pending writes/questions.
- Does not add a DB table, external workflow engine, or new dependency.
